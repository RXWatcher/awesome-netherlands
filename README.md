# Awesome Netherlands 🤝 Awesome Berlin

This guide is a copy of my friend Marlon Bernardes ["Awesome Berlin"](https://github.com/marlonbernardes/awesome-berlin) guide. The work that he did there is amazing. When moving to Netherlands I really missed not having something like what he did for here. 🇳🇱

Thanks again for letting me use [Marlon](https://github.com/marlonbernardes).
I'm sure that your work will help even more people now.
