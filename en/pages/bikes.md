## Bike üö≤

Bicycles are very common here, there are even more bikes than people. Some sites say that here people cycle an average of 2.9km/day!

There are bike lanes and bike lanes almost everywhere. The cyclist is very respected here, after all the whole country rides.

Buy or rent? It really depends on your plans but I advise you to rent first until you decide which bike to have here, how the streets work, which lock to buy (unfortunately a lot of bike get stolen here).
