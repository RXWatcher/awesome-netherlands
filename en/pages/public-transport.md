# Public transport

In general, public transport in the Netherlands is excellent. There is always a train, tram or bus that takes you to your destination.

## Which app to use?

Google Maps works well to show the fastest paths and options.

For trains I use NS's own app: [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity&hl=en_US)

## How to buy tickets

Before buying tickets, you need to decide which ticket to buy.

## Purchasing the transport card

## Purchasing a monthly fee for your transportation card

The price of tickets here is a little high, so it might be worth it to purchase a subscription.

I separated the ones I see people using:

| Type                                                          | Benefit      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 40% discount on weekends and 40% discount outside peak hours. | € 5 / month  |
| Free travel on weekends                                       | € 31 / month |

There are more options here: [NL Subscriptions](https://www.ns.nl/en/nsflex/webshop#/bestelling/producten).

As a monthly member you can use NS bikes. ([See how](https://www.ns.nl/en/door-to-door/ov-fiets/how-the-ov-fiets-works.html))

## Bike

Bicycles are very common here, there are even more bikes than people. Some sites say that here people cycle an average of 2.9km / day!

There are bike lanes and bike lanes almost everywhere. The cyclist is very respected here, after all the whole country rides.

Where to rent: https://swapfiets.nl/en/
Price: € 19
Prerequisites: Have an IBAN (International Bank Account Number)

Buy or rent? It really depends on your plans but I advise you to rent first until you decide which bike to have here, how the streets work, which lock to buy (unfortunately a lot of bike is stolen here).
