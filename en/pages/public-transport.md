# Public transport

In general, public transport in the Netherlands is excellent. There is always a train, tram or bus that takes you to your destination.

## Which app to use?

Google Maps works well to show the fastest paths and options.

For trains I use NS's own app: [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity&hl=en_US)

## How to buy tickets

All the machines have English language options.

## Purchasing the transport card

[Apply for personal ov chipkaart](https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/purchase-an-ov-chipkaart/apply-for-personal-ov-chipkaart.htm)

## Purchasing a subscription

The price of tickets here is a little high, so it might be worth it to purchase a subscription.

I separated the ones I see people using:

| Type                                                          | Benefit      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 40% discount on weekends and 40% discount outside peak hours. | € 5 / month  |
| Free travel on weekends                                       | € 31 / month |

There are more options here: [NL Subscriptions](https://www.ns.nl/en/nsflex/webshop#/bestelling/producten).

As a monthly member you can use NS bikes. ([See how](https://www.ns.nl/en/door-to-door/ov-fiets/how-the-ov-fiets-works.html))
