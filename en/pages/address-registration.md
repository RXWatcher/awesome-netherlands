# Address registration

The residence registration (called Verblijfstitel) is one of the most important - and urgent - steps that must be taken when arriving in the Netherlands. Everyone who comes to live here must attend an _Expat Center_ and register. I recommend that you register in the first days of your stay. The document received after the residence registration is very important, and without it you will not be able to receive your salary, open an account at many banks, sign contracts, etc.

Once you have this document you can use it daily instead of your Passport for simple activities.

## What you need for the registration?

- Passport (or Passports, if more than one person is registered)
- Rental / sublease agreement
- Letter/Contract from the company hiring you
- Birth certificate accompanied by sworn translation
- Couples must bring a marriage certificate accompanied by a sworn translation (see [general tips](#tips))

## How to fill out the form?

In my case, I didn't have to fill anything before going to the Expat Center.
Once there, I was given the form and explained how to fill it out in a very friendly way (normal for Netherlands).

## How the registration works?

- Have all the necessary documents (passport, rental contract, employment contract, etc.)

**1) your company can schedule**

This was my case. Ask your company before making a move.

**2) schedule an appointment at an Expat center by phone**

**3) go directly to the Expat Center, without scheduling**

## Tips

- Most employees can speak English (very well).
- Although some places say that the single / married certificate is a mandatory document, they didn't ask me. Take it anyway!
