# Renting an apartment

## Requirements

Employment contract, your company's payroll, copy of passports.

## Before you start your search

- Long term rents will usually require you to make a security deposit after signing the rental agreement/contract. This will represent 1-3 times the amount of the rent. This amount will be given back to you 1 month after the contract ends.
- The following questions could help you to better pick an apartment during your search:
  - Is it furnished or does it have all the kitchen appliances?
  - Are pets allowed?
  - Do you know/like the neighborhood?
  - Is there a garage/storage room for bikes and other objects?
  - Is the heating via gas, electrical, oil or charcoal? Electrical heatings are usually less effective.j
  - What is the energy efficiency of the apartment? This info can be found in the apartment description.
  - How much is the security deposit?
  - Are there supermarkets and stores close by?
  - How close and easy to access is the public transportation? Where can you get from the apartment using the public transportation?

## Step by step

> Send a PR with more information if you have been there. Telling details like list of interested people, explain that finding a house here is like finding a relationship, there's a queue of people ... ⚠️

## Furnished houses

I'm not sure about the points below but you can make good impressions with the real estate / owner if you:

- Do not have pets
- Have no children (or looking for small houses / apartments)
- No smoking (nothing)

If you have something above, don't worry, it will be a little harder to find but not impossible.

### Security deposit (security deposit)

Generally, the security deposit is between 1 rental and 3 rentals of the property. It must be paid at the entrance to the house.
