# Mandatory Health Insurance

When immigrating to The Netherlands and/or starting to work in The Netherlands, you are obliged to take out the Dutch standard health insurance (also called : ‘basic’ health insurance or ‘governmental’ health insurance).

The standard health insurance should be applied for within 4 months after getting obliged/entitled to the insurance. Normally, within 4 months after entering The Netherlands and/or starting to work in The Netherlands. When not applied for in time, one remains obliged to pay the premium of the standard health insurance (even with a penalty of 30%!), but can only claim medical costs when the application has been approved.
