# Health insurance

When you immigrate to the Netherlands and start working in the Netherlands, you are **required** to take standard Dutch health insurance (also called: "basic" health insurance or "government" health insurance).

Standard health insurance must be applied within 4 months after the obligation (entitlement to insurance). Usually, within 4 months of entering the Netherlands and / or starting work in the Netherlands.

# Watch the deadline

If you miss this deadline and do not apply in time, the person is required to pay the standard health insurance premium (even with a 30% fine!).

But you can only claim medical costs when the application is approved.

Penalty value in 2019: € ​​402.24.

# Rules

You can choose your own health insurance company, however, this can only be changed once a year, with effect from 1 January.
It is also possible to add or remove extra health packs once a year.

# How "Eigen Risico" works

Every year, the government sets the fixed legal value of eigen risico insurance. € 385.

That is, you pay the first € 385 in medical expenses.
Whatever exceeds this amount will be paid directly by your insurer, depending on the policy chosen.

However, you can also negotiate these costs by choosing a voluntary deductible of up to € 885 more.
This way, your "monthly fee" for basic insurance is cheaper.
However, you may possibly have more health care costs than the basic health insurance package.

# International students

International students are not always required to take Dutch health insurance. Whether they are required or not depends on several factors, such as the length of their stay, whether they are doing an internship or working, and whether they have insurance in their home country.
