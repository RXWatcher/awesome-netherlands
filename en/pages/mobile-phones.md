# Pre-paid options

The most known mobile operators in the Netherlands are T-Mobile and Vodafone. The easiest way to get a pre-paid number is finding one store of those providers (tip: there are many of them in the most known Dutch cities).
The SIM Card + activation + initial credit cost around €10 and €25.

Important: to have a contract plan you'll need a BSN (Citizen Service Number). So, until you get your BSN it's highly recommended to start with a pre-paid plan.

# Activation

Each mobile operator has its specific activation process.

Vodafone requires you to call to a specific number, then you should wait until the end of the Dutch speech to get the English menu. After that you just need to follow the steps in this menu.

# Airport

Almost all Dutch airports have their own public Wi-Fi network, in addition there are many other stores that "sells" Wi-Fi signal like Starbucks.
