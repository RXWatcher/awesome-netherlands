- Long term rents will usually require you to make a security deposit after signing the rental agreement/contract. This will represent 1-3 times the amount of the rent. This amount will be given back to you 1 month after the contract ends.
- The following questions could help you to better pick an apartment during your search:
  - Is it furnished or does it have all the kitchen appliances?
  - Are pets allowed?
  - Do you know/like the neighborhood?
  - Is there a garage/storage room for bikes and other objects?
  - Is the heating via gas, electrical, oil or charcoal? Electrical heatings are usually less effective.j
  - What is the energy efficiency of the apartment? This info can be found in the apartment description.
  - How much is the security deposit?
  - Are there supermarkets and stores close by?
  - How close and easy to access is the public transportation? Where can you get from the apartment using the public transportation?
